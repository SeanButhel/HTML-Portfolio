<h1>The Best Movies According to Sean</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of All-Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>This is the first movie that popped into my head. Megan Fox and Alive Cars I guess.</p>
<h3>Beserk</h3>
<p>Very gruesome yet realistic animation on what real life war and fighting would look like. Unlike most PG censored unrealistic shows out there.</p>
<h3>Sword Art Online</h3>
<p>One of my favourite animes that really got me hooked. If you like games and ever wanted an idea of what it would look like to be trapped in a virtual game this is for you!</p>
